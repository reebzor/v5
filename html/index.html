            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Tom Reeb. I live in Philadelphia, PA and I am an Engineer Manager at Comcast.
              My passion for technology stretches beyond my career and reaches far into my personal life;
              this site is where the two worlds converge.
              While the frontend itself serves its intended purpose, the exercise of developing and deploying the platform was my driver for creating it. 
              <br>
              The application is packaged as a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tomreeb/dotcom/">Docker</a> container and the container runs fully serverless on AWS ECS Fargate. 
              Multiple container instances are deployed behind an Application Load Balancer, which redirects and terminates secure connections. 
              While the majority of the stack utilizes Amazon AWS components, such as ELB, ALB, VPC, ECS, ACM, and Route 53, I am also using <a href="https://github.com/tomreeb">GitHub</a> for version control and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tomreeb/dotcom/">Docker Hub</a> as the container registry.
              Build, test, and publish of the container are automated through a Makefile.
